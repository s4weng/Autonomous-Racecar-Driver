ANN for GTR 2 driver.

Work in progress.  Video/pictures where I get my training data have not been uploaded due to size, feel free to send me a message for them.  The training data is all available though.

First promising run.  Can stay on the road for about 5-10 seconds depending on the track before it veers off the road and crashes.  Has a tendency to swerve to the lanes repeatedly; need to alter input data so that it goes straight even if it's just slightly off the middle of the road.  Speedometer OCR may need updating too, mispredictions for 0 as 8 makes acceleration and braking incorrect at times.

Test run 4 fairly successful.  Will get stuck swerving on lanes occasionally, but handles turns, acceleration and brakes well.
